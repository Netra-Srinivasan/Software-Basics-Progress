<h2>Progress Update (as of 05.12.2025)</h2>

I already have prior knowledge of C++, Python, and Linux, and I went through these assigned videos to refresh and strengthen my understanding. 
The concepts covered in the videos helped reinforce what I already knew and gave me an overall recap of the topics.

**1) Programming Languages** - Reviewed and refreshed core concepts in C++; Revisited key fundamentals and practices in Python

**2) Development Environment** – Strengthened my understanding of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)—its workflow, extensions, and usage

**3) Operating Systems** – Reinforced essential Linux commands and concepts
