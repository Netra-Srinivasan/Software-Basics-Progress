Progress Update (as of 05.12.2025)

I already have prior knowledge of C++, Python, and Linux, and I went through all the assigned videos to refresh and strengthen my understanding of these areas. 
The concepts covered in the videos helped reinforce what I already knew and gave me an overall recap of the topics.

1) Programming Languages

  a) Reviewed and refreshed core concepts in C++
  b) Revisited key fundamentals and practices in Python

2) Development Environment
  a) Strengthened my understanding of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)—its workflow, extensions, and usage

3) Operating Systems
  a) Reinforced essential Linux commands and concepts
